Prediction of diabetes based on the signs and symptoms using machine learning algorithms.

## Problem Definition

Diabetes mellitus, often known simply as diabetes, is a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels. Diabetes mellitus is diagnosed with a test for the glucose content in the blood [[wiki]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes). The dataset provides records of some signs and symthoms for people who have and have not diabetes. 

This is a binary classification problem and our aim, in this study, is to come up with a supervised ML model which predicts diabetes for a person who provides the information with high accuracy.
